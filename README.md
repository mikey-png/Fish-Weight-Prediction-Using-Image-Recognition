# Fish-Weight-Prediction-Using-Image-Recognition
This code processes fish images by isolating the fish using HSV masking and contour detection. It calculates the fish's length, height, and area, then saves these measurements along with the fish ID and weight to an Excel file. Processed images with bounding boxes are also saved for reference.
